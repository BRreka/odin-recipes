        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cincinnati chili is a unique type of chili that's flavored with not just chili powder but lots of other spices, including cinnamon, allspice, and cloves. This recipe was handed down to me by Mom, a Cincinnati native. I like mine 4-way, with spaghetti, raw chopped onions, and grated mild Cheddar. Serve oyster crackers on the side.</p>
        <p>Cincinnati chili (or Cincinnati-style chili) is a meat sauce with Mediterranean-inspired flavors that’s traditionally used to top spaghetti or hot dogs. It’s similar to chili con carne, but it’s different in flavor and texture. It’s also used primarily as a topping, while chili con carne is usually served in a bowl. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 quart water, or amount to cover</li>
            <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vinegar</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>½ (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate</li>
            <li>¼ cup chili powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>5 whole cloves</li>
            <li>5 whole allspice berries</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
            <li>Place ground beef in a large pan, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil, stirring and breaking up beef with a fork to a fine texture. Slowly boil until meat is thoroughly cooked, about 30 minutes. </li>
